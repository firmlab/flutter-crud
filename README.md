CRUD example Flutter App with Firebase

## Getting Started

Before build or run, make sure you change the `BASE_URL_API` on `lib/utils/constants.dart` to your firebase URL

You can see the firebase json example here
`/assets/data-example.json`

For now, the login functionality is just a dummy, you can input anything and it will go through.
